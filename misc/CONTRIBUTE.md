## Requirements for a resource to be added

- [x] No judgement or 'willpower' - focus on the actual indiviudal rather than how it sounds!
- [x] Preferably open-source - if not, then organisation/company/author must respect privacy (no sign-ups, etc)
- [x] Preferably free - freeing youreself from addiciton shouldn't be paywalled!

> Every resource will be investigated to be sure its correct for everyone - I am only human, so I may make mitakes!
