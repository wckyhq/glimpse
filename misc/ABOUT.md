## About this list

Many moons ago, I was addicted to pornography. For several years, I struggled to quit because of the advice I often found on YouTube. Then, by chance, I came across an incredible e-book. [The Easy Peasy Method](https://easypeasymethod.org/) changed my life. Instead of forcing discipline and sacrifice on the user, it focuses on the benefits of understanding and affects of brainwashing on the user. From there, the user is free to escape whenever they would like to. 

I then went on to volunteer with the organisation that made it happen. [Peaceful](https://peacefulfoundation.org/) focuses on creating local community through addiction-cessation - this is where I got my inspiration from for this list. 

The name 'Glimpse' comes from the idea of **glimpsing into your future self** - freeing myself from addiction was the best thing I have ever done. 

I hope the same for you.

Best wishes,
